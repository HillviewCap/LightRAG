Trend Micro said it detected \"threat actors attempting to integrate EDRSilencer in their attacks, repurposing it as a means of evading detection.\" EDRSilencer, inspired by the NightHawk FireBlock tool from MDSec, is designed to block outbound traffic of running EDR processes using the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). It supports terminating various processes related to EDR products from Microsoft, Elastic, Trellix, Qualys, SentinelOne, Cybereason, Broadcom Carbon Black, Tanium, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cisco, ESET, HarfangLab, and Trend Micro. By incorporating such legitimate red teaming tools into their arsenal, the goal is to render EDR software ineffective and make it a lot more challenging to identify and remove malware. \"The WFP is a powerful framework built into Windows for creating network filtering and security applications,\" Trend Micro researchers said. \"It provides APIs for developers to define custom rules to monitor, block, or modify network traffic based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and applications.\" \"WFP is used in firewalls, antivirus software, and other security solutions to protect systems and networks.\" EDRSilencer takes advantage of WFP by dynamically identifying running EDR processes and creating persistent WFP filters to block their outbound network communications on both IPv4 and IPv6, thereby preventing security software from sending telemetry to their management consoles. The attack essentially works by scanning the system to gather a list of running processes associated with common EDR products, followed by running EDRSilencer with the argument \"blockedr\" (e.g., EDRSilencer.exe blockedr) to inhibit outbound traffic from those processes by configuring WFP filters. \"This allows malware or other malicious activities to remain undetected, increasing the potential for successful attacks without detection or intervention,\" the researchers said. \"This highlights the ongoing trend of threat actors seeking more effective tools for their attacks, especially those designed to disable antivirus and EDR solutions.\" The development comes as ransomware groups' use of formidable EDR-killing tools like AuKill (aka AvNeutralizer), EDRKillShifter, TrueSightKiller, GhostDriver, and Terminator is on the rise, with these programs weaponizing vulnerable drivers to escalate privileges and terminate security-related processes. \"EDRKillShifter enhances persistence mechanisms by employing techniques that ensure its continuous presence within the system, even after initial compromises are discovered and cleaned,\" Trend Micro said in a recent analysis. \"It dynamically disrupts security processes in real-time and adapts its methods as detection capabilities evolve, staying a step ahead of traditional EDR tools.\" Found this article interesting?

But humans who know how to use AI are going to replace those humans who don't know how to use AI,\" says Etay Maor, Chief Security Strategist at Cato Networks and founding member of Cato CTRL. \"Similarly, attackers are also turning to AI to augment their own capabilities.\" Yet, there is a lot more hype than reality around AI's role in cybercrime. Headlines often sensationalize AI threats, with terms like \"Chaos-GPT\" and \"Black Hat AI Tools,\" even claiming they seek to destroy humanity. However, these articles are more fear-inducing than descriptive of serious threats. For instance, when explored in underground forums, several of these so-called \"AI cyber tools\" were found to be nothing more than rebranded versions of basic public LLMs with no advanced capabilities. In fact, they were even marked by angry attackers as scams. How Hackers are Really Using AI in Cyber Attacks# In reality, cybercriminals are still figuring out how to harness AI effectively. They are experiencing the same issues and shortcomings legitimate users are, like hallucinations and limited abilities. Per their predictions, it will take a few years before they are able to leverage GenAI effectively for hacking needs. For now, GenAI tools are mostly being used for simpler tasks, like writing phishing emails and generating code snippets that can be integrated into attacks. In addition, we've observed attackers providing compromised code to AI systems for analysis, as an effort to \"normalize\" such code as non-malicious. Using AI to Abuse AI: Introducing GPTs# GPTs, introduced by OpenAI on November 6, 2023, are customizable versions of ChatGPT that allow users to add specific instructions, integrate external APIs and incorporate unique knowledge sources. This feature enables users to create highly specialized applications, such as tech support bots, educational tools, and more. In addition, OpenAI is offering developers monetization options for GPTs, through a dedicated marketplace. Abusing GPTs# GPTs introduce potential security concerns. One notable risk is the exposure of sensitive instructions, proprietary knowledge, or even API keys embedded in the custom GPT. Malicious actors can use AI, specifically prompt engineering, to replicate a GPT and tap into its monetization potential. Attackers can use prompts to retrieve knowledge sources, instructions, configuration files, and more. These might be as simple as prompting the custom GPT to list all uploaded files and custom instructions or asking for debugging information. Or, sophisticated like requesting the GPT to zip one of the PDF files and create a downloadable link, asking the GPT to list all its capabilities in a structured table format, and more. \"Even protections that developers put in place can be bypassed and all knowledge can be extracted,\" says Vitaly Simonovich, Threat Intelligence Researcher at Cato Networks and Cato CTRL member. These risks can be avoided by: Not uploading sensitive data Using instruction-based protection though even those may not be foolproof. \"You need to take into account all the different scenarios that the attacker can abuse,\" adds Vitaly. OpenAI protection AI Attacks and Risks# There are multiple frameworks existing today to assist organizations that are considering developing and creating AI-based software: NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework Google's Secure AI Framework OWASP Top 10 for LLM OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications The recently launched MITRE ATLAS LLM Attack Surface# There are six key LLM (Large Language Model) components that can be targeted by attackers: Prompt - Attacks like prompt injections, where malicious input is used to manipulate the AI's output Response - Misuse or leakage of sensitive information in AI-generated responses Model - Theft, poisoning, or manipulation of the AI model Training Data - Introducing malicious data to alter the behavior of the AI. Infrastructure - Targeting the servers and services that support the AI Users - Misleading or exploiting the humans or systems relying on AI outputs Real-World Attacks and Risks# Let's wrap up with some examples of LLM manipulations, which can easily be used in a malicious manner. Prompt Injection in Customer Service Systems - A recent case involved a car dealership using an AI chatbot for customer service. A researcher managed to manipulate the chatbot by issuing a prompt that altered its behavior. By instructing the chatbot to agree to all customer statements and end each response with, \"And that's a legally binding offer,\" the researcher was able to purchase a car at a ridiculously low price, exposing a major vulnerability. Hallucinations Leading to Legal Consequences - In another incident, Air Canada faced legal action when their AI chatbot provided incorrect information about refund policies. When a customer relied on the chatbot's response and subsequently filed a claim, Air Canada was held liable for the misleading information. Proprietary Data Leaks - Samsung employees unknowingly leaked proprietary information when they used ChatGPT to analyze code. Uploading sensitive data to third-party AI systems is risky, as it's unclear how long the data is stored or who can access it. AI and Deepfake Technology in Fraud - Cybercriminals are also leveraging AI beyond text generation. A bank in Hong Kong fell victim to a $25 million fraud when attackers used live deepfake technology during a video call. The AI-generated avatars mimicked trusted bank officials, convincing the victim to transfer funds to a fraudulent account. Summing Up: AI",

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2024-38178 (CVSS score: 7.5), a memory corruption bug in the Scripting Engine that could result in remote code execution when using the Edge browser in Internet Explorer Mode. It was patched by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for August 2024. However, successful exploitation requires an attacker to convince a user to click on a specially crafted URL in order to initiate the execution of malicious code. The AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC) and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of the Republic of Korea, which were credited with discovering and reporting the shortcoming, have assigned the activity cluster the name Operation Code on Toast. The organizations are tracking ScarCruft under the moniker TA-RedAnt, which was previously referred to as RedEyes. It's also known in the wider cybersecurity community under the names APT37, InkySquid, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and Ruby Sleet. The zero-day attack is \"characterized by the exploitation of a specific 'toast' advertisement program that is commonly bundled with various free software,\" ASEC said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. \"'Toast' ads, in Korea, refers to pop-up notifications that appear at the bottom of the PC screen, typically in the lower-right corner.\" The attack chain documented by the South Korean cybersecurity firm shows that the threat actors compromised the server of an unnamed domestic advertising agency that supplies content to the toast ads with the goal of injecting exploit code into the script of the advertisement content. The vulnerability is said to have been triggered when the toast program downloads and renders the booby-trapped content from the server. \"The attacker targeted a specific toast program that utilizes an unsupported [Internet Explorer] module to download advertisement content, ASEC and NCSC said in a joint threat analysis report. \"This vulnerability causes the JavaScript Engine of IE (jscript9.dll) to improperly interpret data types, resulting in a type confusion error. The attacker exploited this vulnerability to infect PCs with the vulnerable toast program installed. Once infected, PCs were subjected to various malicious activities, including remote access.\" The latest version of RokRAT is capable of enumerating files, terminating arbitrary processes, receiving and executing commands received from a remote server, and gathering data from various applications such as KakaoTalk, WeChat, and browsers like Chrome, Edge, Opera, Naver Wales, and Firefox. RokRAT is also notable for using legitimate cloud services like Dropbox, Google Cloud, pCloud, and Yandex Cloud as its command-and-control server, thereby allowing it to blend in with regular traffic in enterprise environments. This is not the first time ScarCruft has weaponized vulnerabilities in the legacy browser to deliver follow-on malware. In recent years, it has been attributed to the exploitation of CVE-2020-1380, another memory corruption flaw in Scripting Engine, and CVE-2022-41128, a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows Scripting Languages. \"The technological level of North Korean hacking organizations has become more advanced, and they are exploiting various vulnerabilities in addition to [Internet Explorer],\" the report said. \"Accordingly, users should update their operating system and software security.\" Found this article interesting?

It's worth pointing out that Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has assigned the moniker PINEAPPLE to a similar intrusion set that delivers the same malware to Brazilian users. Both these campaigns share a point of commonality in that they commence with phishing messages that impersonate official entities such as Receita Federal and aim to trick recipients into downloading a ZIP archive attachment that masquerades as income tax documents. Present within the harmful ZIP file is a Windows shortcut (LNK) that abuses mshta.exe, a legitimate utility meant to run HTML Application files, execute obfuscated JavaScript commands and establish connections to a command-and-control (C2) server. \"While Astaroth might seem like an old banking trojan, its reemergence and continued evolution make it a persistent threat,\" the researchers said. \"Beyond stolen data, its impact extends to long-term damage to consumer trust, regulatory fines, and increased costs from business disruption and downtime as well as recovery and remediation.\" To mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, it's recommended to enforce strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), keep security solutions and software updated, and apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP).

Tracked as CVE-2024-28987 (CVSS score: 9.1), the vulnerability relates to a case of hard-coded credentials that could be abused to gain unauthorized access and make modifications. \"SolarWinds Web Help Desk contains a hardcoded credential vulnerability that could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to access internal functionality and modify data,\" CISA said in an advisory. Details of the flaw were first disclosed by SolarWinds in late August 2024, with cybersecurity firm Horizon3.ai releasing additional technical specifics a month later. The vulnerability \"allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely read and modify all help desk ticket details ‚Äì often containing sensitive information like passwords from reset requests and shared service account credentials,\" security researcher Zach Hanley said. It's currently not clear how the shortcoming is being exploited in real-world attacks, and by whom. That said, the development comes two months after CISA added another flaw in the same software (CVE-2024-28986, CVSS score: 9.8) to the KEV catalog. In light of active abuse, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the latest fixes (version 12.8.3 Hotfix 2 or later) by November 5, 2024, to secure their networks.

The cybersecurity company is tracking the threat actor under the moniker Earth Simnavaz, which is also referred to as APT34, Crambus, Cobalt Gypsy, GreenBug, Hazel Sandstorm (formerly EUROPIUM), and Helix Kitten. The attack chains entail the deployment of a previously undocumented implant that comes with capabilities to exfiltrate credentials through on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers, a tried-and-tested tactic adopted by the adversary in the past, while also incorporating recently disclosed vulnerabilities to its exploit arsenal. CVE-2024-30088, patched by Microsoft in June 2024, concerns a case of privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that could be exploited to gain SYSTEM privileges, assuming the attackers can win a race condition. Initial access to target networks is facilitated by means of infiltrating a vulnerable web server to drop a web shell, followed by dropping the ngrok remote management tool to maintain persistence and move to other endpoints in the network. The privilege escalation vulnerability subsequently serves as a conduit to deliver the backdoor, codenamed STEALHOOK, responsible for transmitting harvested data via the Exchange server to an email address controlled by the attacker in the form of attachments. A notable technique employed by OilRig in the latest set of attacks involves the abuse of the elevated privileges to drop the password filter policy DLL (psgfilter.dll) in order to extract sensitive credentials from domain users via domain controllers or local accounts on local machines. \"The malicious actor took great care in working with the plaintext passwords while implementing the password filter export functions,\" the researchers said. \"The threat actor also utilized plaintext passwords to gain access and deploy tools remotely. The plaintext passwords were first encrypted before being exfiltrated when sent over networks.\" It's worth noting that the use of psgfilter.dll was observed back in December 2022 in a connection with a campaign targeting organizations in the Middle East using another backdoor dubbed MrPerfectionManager. \"Their recent activity suggests that Earth Simnavaz is focused on abusing vulnerabilities in key infrastructure of geopolitically sensitive regions,\" the researchers noted. \"They also seek to establish a persistent foothold in compromised entities, so these can be weaponized to launch attacks on additional targets.\" Found this article interesting?

The law enforcement action ‚Äì codenamed Operation Token Mirrors ‚Äì is the result of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) taking the \"unprecedented step\" of creating its own cryptocurrency token and company called NexFundAI. NexFundAI, as per information on the website, was marketed as redefining the \"intersection between finance and artificial intelligence\" and that its aim was to \"create a cryptocurrency token that not only serves as a secure store of value but also acts as a catalyst for positive change in the world of AI.\" \"Three market makers ‚Äî ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade ‚Äî along with their employees are charged with allegedly wash trading and/or conspiring to wash trade on behalf of NexFundAI, a cryptocurrency company and token created at the direction of law enforcement as part of the government's investigation,\" the DoJ said. \"A fourth market maker, Gotbit, its CEO, and two of its directors are also charged for perpetrating a similar scheme.\" A total of 18 people and entities have been ensnared in the investigation's net, out of which five defendants have either pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty. Three other defendants have been arrested in the U.S. state of Texas, the U.K., and Portugal. More than $25 million in cryptocurrency has also been confiscated and multiple trading bots behind wash trading (aka round trip trading), which refers to the illegal practice of buying and selling the same financial instruments to create artificial market activity, for about 60 different cryptocurrencies have been disabled. Court documents allege that the defendants behind the cryptocurrency companies executed bogus trades using their own tokens to give the impression that they are good investments in an attempt to attract new investors and purchasers, thereby synthetically inflating the tokens' trading prices. The individuals then sold their tokens at the new prices, a fraudulent scheme known as pump-and-dump, in order to illegally profit from the financial crime. The following individuals and cryptocurrency firms have been charged - Aleksei Andriunin, Fedor Kedrov, Qawi Jalili, Gotbit Consulting LLC (Gotbit) Riqui Liu, Baijun Ou, ZM Quant Investment LTD (ZM Quant) Andrey Zhorzhes, CLS Global FZC, LLC (CLS) Liu Zhou, MyTrade MM Manpreet Kohli, Haroon Mohsini, Nam Tran, Max Hernandez, Russell Armand, Vy Pham, Saitama LLC (Saitama) Robo Inu Finance (Robo Inu) Michael Thompson, VZZN, and Bradley Beatty, Lillian Finance LLC (Lillian Finance) \"Today's enforcement actions demonstrate, once more, that retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the markets for crypto assets,\" Sanjay Wadhwa, deputy director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said. \"With purported promoters and self-anointed market makers teaming up to target the investing public with false promises of profits in the crypto markets, investors should be mindful that the deck may be stacked against them.\" Found this article interesting?

The end goal of the malware is to steal sensitive data entered on e-commerce checkout or admin pages, including financial information, which are then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server. The skimmer, which typically manifests in the form of an inline script on compromised sites that fetches the actual payload from an external server, also attempts to evade analysis and debugging efforts by disabling certain functions when a web browser's developer tools is opened. \"The skimmer uses well-known techniques to ensure compatibility across different browsers by employing both modern and legacy event-handling techniques,\" Jscrambler's Pedro Fortuna said. \"This guarantees it can target a wide range of users, regardless of their browser version.\" The client-side protection and compliance company said it also observed what it described as an \"unusual\" loader variant that loads the skimmer script only in instances where user interaction events such as scrolling, mouse movements, and touchstart are detected. This technique, it added, could serve both as an effective anti-bot measure and a way to ensure that the loading of the skimmer is not causing performance bottlenecks. One of the Magento sites compromised to deliver the Mongolian skimmer is also said to have targeted by a separate skimmer actor, with the two activity clusters leveraging source code comments to interact with each other and divide the profits. \"50/50 maybe?,\" remarked one of the threat actors on September 24, 2024. Three days later, the other group responded: \"I agree 50/50, you can add your code :)\" Then on September 30, the first threat actor replied back, stating \"Alright ) so how can I contact you though? U have acc on exploit? [sic],\" likely referring to the Exploit cybercrime forum. It's currently not known as to how the skimmer malware is delivered to target websites, although it's believed that the attackers are setting their sights on misconfigured or vulnerable Magento or Opencart instances. \"We have multiple victim websites, which might have been breached using different methods,\" Fortuna told The Hacker News. \"We don't know exactly how they got there and were able to inject the web skimmer, but all signs point to compromised Magento or Opencart instances, either because they were poorly configured or because they had vulnerable components that the attackers exploited to get in.\" \"The obfuscation techniques found on this skimmer may have looked to the untrained eye as a new obfuscation method, but that was not the case,\" Fortuna noted. \"It used old techniques to appear more obfuscated, but they are just as easy to reverse.\" Found this article interesting?

Of the 118 flaws, three are rated Critical, 113 are rated Important, and two are rated Moderate in severity. The Patch Tuesday update doesn't include the 25 additional flaws that the tech giant addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser over the past month. Five of the vulnerabilities are listed as publicly known at the time of release, with two of them coming under active exploitation as a zero-day - CVE-2024-43572 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Microsoft Management Console Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Exploitation detected) CVE-2024-43573 (CVSS score: 6.5) - Windows MSHTML Platform Spoofing Vulnerability (Exploitation Detected) CVE-2024-43583 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Winlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2024-20659 (CVSS score: 7.1) - Windows Hyper-V Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability CVE-2024-6197 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Open Source Curl Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (non-Microsoft CVE) It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43573 is similar to CVE-2024-38112 and CVE-2024-43461, two other MSHTML spoofing flaws that have been exploited prior to July 2024 by the Void Banshee threat actor to deliver the Atlantida Stealer malware. Microsoft makes no mention of how the two vulnerabilities are exploited in the wild, and by whom, or how widespread they are. It credited researchers Andres and Shady for reporting CVE-2024-43572, but no acknowledgment has been given for CVE-2024-43573, raising the possibility that it could be a case of patch bypass. \"Since the discovery of CVE-2024-43572, Microsoft now prevents untrusted MSC files from being opened on a system,\" Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. The active exploitation of CVE-2024-43572 and CVE-2024-43573 has also been noted by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which added them to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by October 29, 2024. Among all the flaws disclosed by Redmond on Tuesday, the most severe concerns a remote execution flaw in Microsoft Configuration Manager (CVE-2024-43468, CVSS score: 9.8) that could allow unauthenticated actors to run arbitrary commands. \"An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the target environment which are processed in an unsafe manner enabling the attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database,\" it said. Two other Critical-rated severity flaws also relate to remote code execution in Visual Studio Code extension for Arduino (CVE-2024-43488, CVSS score: 8.8) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Server (CVE-2024-43582, CVSS score: 8.1). \"Exploitation requires an attacker to send deliberately-malformed packets to a Windows RPC host, and leads to code execution in the context of the RPC service, although what this means in practice may depend on factors including RPC Interface Restriction configuration on the target asset,\" Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said about CVE-2024-43582. \"One silver lining: attack complexity is high, since the attacker must win a race condition to access memory improperly.\" Software Patches from Other Vendors# Outside of Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors over the past few weeks to rectify several vulnerabilities, including ‚Äî Adobe Amazon Web Services Apache Avro Apple AutomationDirect Bosch Broadcom (including VMware) Cisco (including Splunk) Citrix CODESYS Dell Draytek Drupal F5 Fortinet GitLab Google Android Google Chrome Google Cloud Hitachi Energy HP HP Enterprise (including Aruba Networks) IBM Intel Ivanti Jenkins Juniper Networks Lenovo Linux distributions Amazon Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Rocky Linux, SUSE, and Ubuntu MediaTek Mitsubishi Electric MongoDB Mozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird NVIDIA Okta Palo Alto Networks Progress Software QNAP Qualcomm Rockwell Automation Salesforce Tableau Samsung SAP Schneider Electric Siemens Sophos Synology Trend Micro Veritas Zoom, and Zyxel Found this article interesting?

Victims included a South Asian embassy in Belarus and a European Union (E.U.) government organization, Slovak cybersecurity company ESET said. \"The ultimate goal of GoldenJackal seems to be stealing confidential information, especially from high-profile machines that might not be connected to the internet,\" security researcher Mat√≠as Porolli noted in an exhaustive analysis. GoldenJackal first came to light in May 2023, when Russian security vendor Kaspersky detailed the threat cluster's attacks on government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. The adversary's origins stretch back to at least 2019. An important characteristic of the intrusions is the use of a worm named JackalWorm that's capable of infecting connected USB drives and delivering a trojan dubbed JackalControl. While there is insufficient information to conclusively tie the activities to a specific nation-state threat, there is some tactical overlap with malicious tools used in campaigns linked to Turla and MoustachedBouncer, the latter of which has also singled out foreign embassies in Belarus. ESET said it discovered GoldenJackal artifacts at a South Asian embassy in Belarus in August and September 2019, and again in July 2021. Of particular interest is how the threat actor also managed to deploy a completely revamped toolset between May 2022 and March 2024 against an E.U. government entity. \"With the level of sophistication required, it is quite unusual that in five years, GoldenJackal managed to build and deploy not one, but two separate toolsets designed to compromise air-gapped systems,\" Porolli pointed out. \"This speaks to the resourcefulness of the group.\" The attack against the South Asian embassy in Belarus is said to have made use of three different malware families, in addition to JackalControl, JackalSteal, and JackalWorm - GoldenDealer, which is used to deliver executables to the air-gapped system via compromised USB drives GoldenHowl, a modular backdoor with capabilities to steal files, create scheduled tasks, upload/download files to and from a remote server, and create an SSH tunnel, and GoldenRobo, a file collector and data exfiltration tool The attacks targeting the unnamed government organization in Europe, on the other hand, have been found to rely on an entirely new set of malware tools mostly written in Go. They are engineered to collect files from USB drives, spread malware via USB drives, exfiltrate data, and use some machine servers as staging servers to distribute payloads to other hosts - GoldenUsbCopy and its improved successor GoldenUsbGo, which monitor USB drives and copy files for exfiltration GoldenAce, which is used to propagate the malware, including a lightweight version of JackalWorm, to other systems (not necessarily those that are air-gapped) using USB drives GoldenBlacklist and its Python implementation GoldenPyBlacklist, which are designed to process email messages of interest for subsequent exfiltration GoldenMailer, which sends the stolen information to attackers via email, and GoldenDrive, which uploads stolen information to Google Drive It's currently not known as to how GoldenJackal manages to gain initial compromise to breach target environments. However, Kaspersky previously alluded to the possibility of trojanized Skype installers and malicious Microsoft Word documents as entry points. GoldenDealer, which is already present in a computer connected to the internet and delivered via an as-yet-undetermined mechanism, springs into action when a USB drive is inserted, causing itself and an unknown worm component to be copied into the removable device. It's suspected that the unknown component is executed when the infected USB drive is connected to the air-gapped system, following which GoldenDealer saves information about the machine to the USB drive. When the USB device is inserted into the aforementioned internet-connected machine a second time, GoldenDealer passes the information stored in the drive to an external server, which then responds with appropriate payloads to be run on the air-gapped system. The malware is also responsible for copying the downloaded executables to the USB drive. In the last stage, when the device is connected to the air-gapped machine again, GoldenDealer takes the copied executables and runs them. For its part, GoldenRobo is also executed on the internet-connected PC and is equipped to take the files from the USB drive and transmit them to the attacker-controlled server. The malware, written in Go, gets its name from the use of a legitimate Windows utility called robocopy to copy the files. ESET said it has yet to uncover a separate module that takes care of copying the files from the air-gapped computer to the USB drive itself. \"Managing to deploy two separate toolsets for breaching air-gapped networks in only five years shows that GoldenJackal is a sophisticated threat actor aware of network segmentation used by its targets,\" Porolli said.

Cybersecurity firm NSFOCUS, which identified the activity last month, said the botnet \"issued over 300,000 attack commands, with a shocking attack density\" between September 4 and September 27, 2024. No less than 20,000 commands designed to mount distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have been issued from the botnet every day on average. The botnet is said to have targeted more than 100 countries, attacking universities, government websites, telecoms, banks, gaming, and gambling sectors. China, the U.S., Canada, and Germany have emerged as the most attacked countries. The Beijing-headquartered company said Gorilla primarily uses UDP flood, ACK BYPASS flood, Valve Source Engine (VSE) flood, SYN flood, and ACK flood to conduct the DDoS attacks, adding the connectionless nature of the UDP protocol allows for arbitrary source IP spoofing to generate a large amount of traffic. Besides supporting multiple CPU architectures such as ARM, MIPS, x86_64, and x86, the botnet comes with capabilities to connect with one of the five predefined command-and-control (C2) servers to await DDoS commands. In an interesting twist, the malware also embeds functions to exploit a security flaw in Apache Hadoop YARN RPC to achieve remote code execution. It's worth noting that the shortcoming has been abused in the wild as far back as 2021, according to Alibaba Cloud and Trend Micro. Persistence on the host is achieved by creating a service file named custom.service in the \"/etc/systemd/system/\" directory and configuring it to run automatically every time at system startup. The service, for its part, is responsible for downloading and executing a shell script (\"lol.sh\") from a remote server (\"pen.gorillafirewall[.]su\"). Similar commands are also added to \"/etc/inittab,\" \"/etc/profile,\" and \"/boot/bootcmd\" files to download and run the shell script upon system startup or user login. \"It introduced various DDoS attack methods and used encryption algorithms commonly employed by the Keksec group to hide key information, while employing multiple techniques to maintain long-term control over IoT devices and cloud hosts, demonstrating a high level of counter-detection awareness as an emerging botnet family,\" NSFOCUS said. Update# A security researcher who goes by the online alias Fox_threatintel, in a post shared on X, said the botnet malware is not entirely new and that it has been active for over a year.

That's according to The Economic Impact of API and Bot Attacks report from Imperva, a Thales company. The report highlights that these security threats account for up to 11.8% of global cyber events and losses, emphasizing the escalating risks they pose to businesses worldwide. Drawing on a comprehensive study conducted by the Marsh McLennan Cyber Risk Intelligence Center, the report analyzes over 161,000 unique cybersecurity incidents. The findings demonstrate a concerning trend: the threats posed by vulnerable or insecure APIs and automated abuse by bots are increasingly interconnected and prevalent. Imperva warns that failing to address security risks associated with these threats could lead to substantial financial and reputational damage. API Adoption and the Expanding Attack Surface# APIs have become indispensable to modern business operations, enabling seamless communication and data exchange across applications and services. They power everything from mobile applications to eCommerce platforms and open banking. However, their widespread adoption has created significant security challenges. According to data from Imperva Threat Research, the average enterprise managed 613 API endpoints in production last year, and that number is projected to grow as companies rely more heavily on APIs to drive digital transformation and innovation. This heightened reliance on APIs has dramatically expanded the attack surface, with API-related security incidents increasing by 40% in 2022 and an additional 9% in 2023. These attacks are particularly dangerous because APIs often serve as direct pathways to an organization's underlying infrastructure and sensitive data. The report estimates that API insecurity is responsible for up to $87 billion in annual losses, a $12 billion increase from 2021. This can be attributed to a variety of reasons, including the rapid adoption of APIs, inexperience of many API developers, lack of standardized security practices, and limited collaboration between development and security teams. Bot Attacks: A Persistent and Evolving Threat# Alongside the rise in attacks on APIs, bot attacks have become a widespread and costly threat, resulting in up to $116 billion in losses annually. Bots‚Äîautomated software programs designed to perform specific tasks‚Äîare frequently weaponized for malicious activities such as credential stuffing, web scraping, online fraud, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In 2022, security incidents related to bots surged by 88%, followed by an additional 28% increase in 2023. This alarming growth was fueled by a combination of factors, including the rise in digital transactions, proliferation of APIs, and geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The widespread availability of attack tools and generative AI models has also significantly enhanced bot evasion techniques and enabled even low-skilled attackers to carry out sophisticated bot attacks. According to Imperva, bots now represent one of the most critical threats to API security. Last year, 30% of all API attacks were driven by automated threats, with 17% specifically tied to bots exploiting business logic vulnerabilities. The growing reliance on APIs‚Äîand their direct access to sensitive data‚Äîhas made them prime targets for bot operators. Automated API abuse alone is now costing businesses up to $17.9 billion annually. As bots become more sophisticated, attackers are increasingly using them to exploit API business logic, bypass security measures, and exfiltrate sensitive data, making detection and mitigation more challenging for organizations. Large Enterprises at Greater Risk# Large enterprises, especially those with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion, face a disproportionately higher risk of API and bot attacks. According to the report, these organizations are 2-3 times more likely to experience automated API abuse by bots compared to small or mid-size businesses. This heightened exposure is primarily driven by the complexity and scale of their digital infrastructures. These companies typically manage hundreds or even thousands of APIs across multiple departments and services, creating sprawling API ecosystems that are challenging to monitor and secure. Within such environments, shadow APIs, unauthenticated APIs, and deprecated APIs present significant vulnerabilities. These mismanaged APIs often lack critical security measures, such as regular updates, authentication, and continuous monitoring, leaving them open to exploitation. Similarly, large enterprises are prime targets for bot attacks due to their extensive digital presence and valuable assets. The more complex the digital environment, the more potential entry points exist for bots to exploit, ranging from login pages to checkout systems. With vast amounts of sensitive data flowing through their applications and APIs, these companies are a highly lucrative target for bot operators. The risk is even more pronounced for enterprises with annual revenues exceeding $100 billion, where API insecurity and bot attacks account for as much as 26% of all security incidents. This stark figure highlights the critical need for comprehensive API security and bot management strategies in large enterprises, where a security incident can result in significant operational disruptions, substantial financial losses, and long-lasting reputational damage. Protecting Against API and Bot Attacks# Together, vulnerable or insecure APIs and automated abuse by bots account for billions of dollars in annual losses. As businesses increasingly rely on APIs to power digital transformation, the risk of security incidents is expected to rise, putting organizations at greater risk of financial and reputational damage. Simultaneously, the evolution of bots, often driven by generative AI, has amplified the challenges of defending against these threats. To effectively mitigate these risks, Imperva recommends that organizations take the following proactive steps: Foster cross-functional collaboration: Collaboration between security and development teams is essential for embedding security into every stage of the API lifecycle.

This partnership ensures that security measures are integrated from design to deployment, enabling proactive identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. When it comes to bot management, this collaboration must extend even further. Bots are a cross-functional challenge that impacts many areas of the business. To effectively combat them, teams across marketing, eCommerce, customer experience, IT, Line of Business, and security must work closely together. This broader collaboration helps identify vulnerable features, such as login pages, checkout processes, and forms, that are particularly susceptible to bot attacks. Comprehensive API discovery and monitoring: Organizations must have full visibility into all their APIs, including shadow, deprecated, and unauthenticated APIs, to ensure none are overlooked. Continuous monitoring and auditing are essential to identifying potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Integrate API security and bot management: Bot management and API security must be used in tandem to successfully mitigate automated attacks on API libraries. This combined approach helps identify vulnerable APIs, continuously monitors for automated attacks, and provides actionable insights for rapid detection and response. By integrating bot management and API security, businesses can better protect against sophisticated automated threats while gaining visibility to detect and mitigate risks before they cause a security incident. As API ecosystems continue to expand and bots become more sophisticated, the cost of inaction will only rise. Organizations must address the security risks associated with APIs and bots to protect sensitive data, mitigate financial losses, and safeguard their brand reputation. Found this article interesting?
